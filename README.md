I coded this project, finishing the code in around October (2024) of my second year doing A-levels, and finishing the report around January the year after (2025).
This was my Computer Science project which scored an A*, it is a text editor and whiteboard linked together with a dashboard and login system, and the files and folders can be shared and concurrently accessed by multiple users.
